  <h2 class="h2Welcome">Who we are</h2>
  <p class="textWelcome">
    Located in <strong>Mountain View</strong>, we are a bilingual preschool center that supports the Russian culture and language within an American context. 
    We recognize that by providing a bilingual and bicultural environment, we are supporting the cognitive development of the child, as well as 
    the relationships between the children and their families. Additionally, we provide nutritious, traditional Russian lunches as part of our program.

  <h2 class="h2Welcome">Philosophy</h2>
  <p class="textWelcome">
    At Tiny Einstein Child Development Center, we believe in providing children with the best! Our approach is one that integrates play with the 
    academics children need to succeed in later schooling.  We recognize that children must learn to navigate socially and emotionally first before 
    tackling academic endeavors. At <strong>Tiny Einstein</strong> you will see this approach in action as the academics become more rigorous as the children 
    age (see our classroom daily schedules for evidence of this approach).

  <p class="textWelcome">
    Our brand-new custom center supports the needs of our children completely, by providing them with the space and materials to fully explore and learn. 
    We take our cues from the interests of the children, and expand on those interests by providing hands-on opportunities to learn.  We support learning 
    in all domains including dramatic play, math, literacy, art, science, music, and gymnastics and bring in professionals to work with the children and 
    share their passions. We are inspired by and integrate components of several philosophies into our program, including <strong>Traditional Russian Schooling</strong>, 
    <strong>Reggio Emilia</strong>, and <strong>Montessori</strong>.

  <p class="textWelcome"> 
    Our staff consists of a mix of native Russian and English speaking teachers who you will get to know well through our continuity of care approach. 
    Every effort is made to allow children and their teachers to continue their relationships by moving up through the age groups (classrooms) together. 
    We believe in the relationships and attachments that happen between children and teachers and know that children thrive and learn best when those 
    emotional needs are being met first.
