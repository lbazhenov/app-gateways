  At <strong>Tiny Einstein Child Development Center</strong>, we believe that each child has a gift and a great potential. 
  Our enriched curriculum covers all the possible ways of child development that would help to reveal talents and potential of the students. 
  Professional educators and pedagogues have been working many years to create the best well-rounded, collaborative, bilingual developmental 
  program that would enable every part of child’s brain. Every day is designed in a way that doesn’t overwhelm, but brings various interesting 
  activities within the preschool setting.
